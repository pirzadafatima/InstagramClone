# Instagram Clone
An Instagram-inspired social media app built using Android Studio, Firebase, and Java. The app allows users to sign up, log in, upload photos, view others' posts, and interact with content through likes and comments.

## üöÄ Features
_User Authentication:_ Users can sign up, log in using email and password, and even log out of the app. <br/><br/>
User Profiles: Users can create and edit profiles with a profile picture, bio, and view their own posts in a grid format. Profile pages also show the number of posts, followers, and following. <br/><br/>
Privacy Settings (Public/Private Accounts): <br/><br/>
  ‚óè Public Accounts: Anyone can view posts, reels, and follow the user. <br/><br/>
  ‚óè Private Accounts: Only approved followers can see the user‚Äôs posts and reels. When someone requests to follow a private account, the account owner must approve or deny the request. <br/><br/>
Photo and Reels Upload: Users can upload images or short videos (Reels, up to 30 seconds) with captions either from their devices or from their camera. Photos and Reels will appear in the user‚Äôs feed and profile grid, and can be interacted with based on account privacy settings. <br/><br/>
Feed: A scrollable feed shows posts (photos and Reels) from followers of a specific user. Each post will display the image/video, caption, username, and interaction options (like, comment). For private accounts, only approved followers will see their posts. <br/><br/>
Likes and Comments: Users can like and comment on posts. The number of likes and recent comments will be visible below each post. Comments are simple text-based interactions. <br/><br/>
Follow/Unfollow Users: Users can follow or unfollow other users, and their feed will update to show posts from users they follow. User profiles will display follower and following counts. <br/><br/>
Explore Page: A dedicated Explore page will allow users to discover new content, displaying popular or recent posts from all users. This page will show a grid of posts, based on likes and popularity, but will not include any advanced algorithm-driven personalization. <br/><br/>
Basic Search Functionality: Users can search for other users by username, allowing them to discover and follow new people. <br/><br/>
Notifications (Simplified): A basic notification system will inform users when someone likes or comments on their posts or when a new user follows them. Notifications will be displayed in-app, not real-time. <br/><br/>
